# u-blox Zephyr Downstream

This repository maintains a downstream branch of the Zephyr RTOS, tailored for u-blox Evaluation Kits (EVK). By following a strict Zephyr version, it delivers hardware support files and configurations for u-blox EVK, allowing for the rapid integration of custom features and fixes.

**Note:** Use with u-blox boards is supported on a best-effort basis; full compatibility or support for all hardware is not guaranteed.

## Essential Information

- The reference Zephyr build setup, including essential files and configurations, provided in this repository is intended for use with Evaluation Kits available from u-blox. Data sheets and additional information about the modules and EVKs are available on the u-blox website: https://www.u-blox.com/.
- For upstream development or general Zephyr usage, please refer to the official Zephyr repository.
